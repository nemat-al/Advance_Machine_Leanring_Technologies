## [Interpretable ML](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Advance_Machine_Leanring_Technologies/blob/main/Interpretable%20ML/AML_T02.ipynb)
The task is to analyze the feature importance in the dataset for making predictions by the trained model [LIME frameworks](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime). The datast is a set of labeled messages, a Naive Bayes model was trained to classify messages to: 'spam' or 'ham'. Then LIME was used to explain the prediction of the model over one test example.

## [Image Quality Assessment](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Advance_Machine_Leanring_Technologies/blob/main/Image%20Quality%20Assessment/AMLT_Task_04.ipynb)
The file contains different non reference image quality assessments applied on a dataset of 20 images. The results are compared to my own ranking of the images by computing pearson correlation.
